Notes
=====
* Master version is always under heavy development and it is not recommended for use, it will probably have unfixed bugs.  Please use the latest stable branch.
* From 4.0 onwards (current master), OpenUDS has been splited in serveral repositories and contains submodules. Remember to use "git clone --resursive ..." to fetch it ;-).
