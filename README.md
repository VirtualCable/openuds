Notes
=====
* From 4.0 onwards (current master), OpenUDS has been splitted in several repositories and contains submodules. Remember to use "git clone --resursive ..." to fetch it ;-).
* 4.0 version is tested on Python 3.11. It will probably work on 3.12 and 3.13 too (maybe 3.10, but not tested also)
