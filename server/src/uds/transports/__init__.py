Transport modules for UDS are contained inside this package.
To create a new transport module, you will need to follow this steps:
    1.- Create the transport module, probably based on an existing one
    2.- Insert the module package as child of this package
    3.- Import the class of your transport module at __init__. For example::
        from Transport import SimpleTransport
    4.- Done. At Server restart, the module will be recognized, loaded and treated

The registration of modules is done locating subclases of :py:class:`uds.core.auths.Authentication`
