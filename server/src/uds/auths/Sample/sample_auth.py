        This method is invoked by UDS whenever it needs an user to be authenticated.
        It is used from web interface, but also from administration interface to
        check credentials and access of user.

        The tricky part of this method is the groupsManager, but it's easy to
        understand what is used it for.

        Imagine some authenticator, for example, an LDAP. It has its users, it has
        its groups, and it has it relations (which user belongs to which group).

        Now think about UDS. UDS know nothing about this, it only knows what
        the administator has entered at admin interface (groups mainly, but he can
        create users also).

        UDS knows about this groups, but we need to relation those with the ones
        know by the authenticator.

        To do this, we have created a simple mechanism, where the authenticator
        receives a groupsManager, that knows all groups known by UDS, and has
        the method so the authenticator can say, for the username being validated,
        to which uds groups it belongs to.

        This is done using the :py:meth:uds.core.auths.groups_manager.GroupsManager.validate
        method of the provided groups manager.

        At return, UDS will do two things:
           * If there is no group inside the groupsManager mareked as valid, it will
             denied access.
           * If there is some groups marked as valid, it will refresh the known
             UDS relations (this means that the database will be refresehd so the user
             has valid groups).

        This also means that the group membership is only checked at user login (well,
        in fact its also checked when an administrator tries to modify an user)

        So, authenticate must not also validate the user credentials, but also
        indicate the group membership of this user inside UDS.
