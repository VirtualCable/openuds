    """
    Base class for all modules used by UDS.
    This base module provides all the needed methods that modules must implement

    All modules must, at least, implement the following:

    * Attributes:
       * :py:attr:`.type_name`:
         Name for this type of module (human readable) to assign to the module (string)
         This name will be used to let the administrator identify this module.
       * :py:attr:`.type_type`:
         Name for this type of module (machine only) to assing to the module (string)
         This name will be used internally to identify when a serialized module corresponds with this class.
       * :py:attr:`.type_description`:
         Description for this type of module.
         This descriptio will be used to let the administrator identify what this module provides
       * :py:attr:`.icon_file`: This is an icon file, in png format, used at administration client to identify this module.
         This parameter may be optionall if you override the "icon" method.
    * Own Methods:
       * :py:meth:`.__init__`
         The default constructor. The environment value is always provided (see Environment), but the
         default values provided can be None.
         Remember to allow the instantiation of the module with default params, because when deserialization is done,
         the process is first instatiate with an environment but no parameters and then call "unmarshal" from Serializable.
       * :py:meth:`.test`
       * :py:meth:`.check`
       * :py:meth:`.destroy`: Optional
       * :py:meth:`.icon`: Optional, if you provide an icon file, this method loads it from module folder,
         but you can override this so the icon is obtained from other source.
       * :py:meth:`.marshal`
         By default, this method serializes the values provided by user in form fields. You can override it,
         but now it's not needed because you can access config vars using Form Fields.

         Anyway, if you override this method, you must also override next one
       * :py:meth:`.unmarshal`
         By default, this method de-serializes the values provided by user in form fields. You can override it,
         but now it's not needed because you can access config vars using Form Fields.

         Anyway, if you override this method, you must also override previous one

    * UserInterface Methods:
       * :py:meth:`from from uds.core.ui.dict_of_values`
         This method, by default, provides the values contained in the form fields. If you don't override the marshal and
         unmarshal, this method should be fine as is for you also.


    Environmentable is a base class that provides utility method to access a separate Environment for every single
    module.
