class UserService(Environmentable, Serializable):
    """
    Interface for user services.

    This class provides the needed logic for implementing an "consumable user service",
    that are the elements that the user will interact with.

    A good way to understand this class is to look at the sample services provided
    with the documentation.

    As with all modules interfaces, if you override __init__ method,
    do not forget to invoke this class __init__  method as this::

       super(self.__class__, self).__init__(environment, **kwargs)

    This is a MUST (if you override __init___), so internal structured gets filled correctly, so don't forget it!.

    The preferred way of initializing, is to provide :py:meth:`.initialize`, that
    will be invoked just after all initialization stuff is done at __init__.

    Normally objects of classes deriving from this one, will be serialized, called,
    deserialized. This means that all that you want to ensure that is keeped inside
    the class must be serialized and deserialized, because there is no warantee that
    the object will get two methods invoked without haven't been remoded from memory
    and loaded again, this means, IMPLEMENT marshal and unmarshal with all attributes
    that you want to keep.


    Things to know about this class:

      * Once a deployment is done, it will never be called again for same instance
        object
      * The method getUniqueId will be invoked after call to deploys and check.
        You can change it on the fly, but remember that uniqueId is the "keyword"
        used inside services to communicate with os managers (os manager will
        receive an instance of UserDeployment, and this will be located via that
        uniqueId)

        Uniques ids can be repeated at database level, to let it come at a later
        deployment stage, but if two services has same uniqueid at a time,
        os manager will simply not work.
      * suggestedTime is always accessed through instance objects, and used after
        deployForCache, deployForUser and moveToCache it these methods returns
        RUNNING
      * Checks (if a deployment has finished, or the cache movement is finished)
        are always done using checkState(). It is secuential, i mean, will only
        be called when a deployment,a cache movement or a cancel operation is
        running
      * If the service that supports this deployeds do not use L2 cache, the
        moveCache method will never be invoked
      * The L1 cache should be a fast access cache (i.e. running service but
        not assigned to an user), while L2 cache should be non consuming or
        almost-non-consuming service. This means that if we cannont make an
        slower an less resources consumable form for a service, this should
        not have an L2 cache (slower is not a must,
        but probably it will be slower to recover from L2 cache than from L1,
        but faster than creating a new service)
        Ofc, if a service has an "Instant" creation, it don't needs cache...
      * We do not expect any exception from these methods, but if there is an
        error, the method can return "ERROR". To show the reason of error, the
        method reasonOfError can be called multiple times, including
        serializations in middle, so remember to include reason of error in serializations

        before presenting it (via transport rendering) to the user.

        example), it will return "State.ERROR" and store a reason of error so UDS
        can ask for it and present this information to the Administrator.

        directly usable but can be put in an usable state, it will return

    def deployForCache(self, cacheLevel: int) -> str:

        Deploys a user deployment as cache.

        This is a task method. As that, the expected return values are
        State values RUNNING, FINISHED or ERROR.

        The objective of this method is providing a cache copy of an user consumable,
        and will be invoked whenever the core need to create a new copy for cache
        of the service this UserDeployment manages.

        Things to take care with this method are:

           * cacheLevel can be L1 or L2 (class constants)
           * If a deploy for cache is asked for a L1 cache, the generated
             element is expected to be all-done for user consume. L1 cache items
             will get directly assigned to users whenever needed, and are expected
             to be fast. (You always have setReady method to do anything else needed
             to assign the cache element to an user, but generally L1 cached items
             must be ready to use.
           * An L2 cache is expected to be an cached element that is "almost ready".
             The main idea behind L2 is to keep some elements almost usable by users
             but in an state that they do not consume (or consumes much less) resources.
             If your L2 cache consumes the same that L1 cache, L2 cache is in fact not
             needed.
           * This works as :py:meth:.deployForUser, meaning that you can take a look
             also to that method for more info

        :note: If your service uses caching, this method MUST be provided. If it
               do not uses cache, this method will never get called, so you can

        This is a task method. As that, the excepted return values are

        The user parameter is not neded, but provided. It indicates the
        Database User Object (see py:mod:`uds.modules`) to which this deployed
        user service will be assigned to.

        This method will get called whenever a new deployed service for an user
        is needed. This will give this class the oportunity to create
        a service that is assigned to an user.

        The way of using this method is as follows:

        If the service gets created in "one step", that is, before the return
        of this method, the consumable service for the user gets created, it
        will return "State.FINISH".
        If the service needs more steps (as in this case), we will return

        newLevel is L1, the actual is L2, and if it is L2, the actual is L1.

        Actually there is no possibility to move assigned services again back to
        cache. If some service needs that kind of functionallity, this must be
        provided at service level (for example, when doing publishing creating
        a number of services that will be used, released and reused by users).

               this method.
