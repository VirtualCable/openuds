    Base Service Provider Class.

    All classes that will represent a service provider will need to be derived
    from this class.

    The preferred way of using this class is by its alias name, provided
    at uds.core.services module, ServiceProvider.

    This is a very basic class, intended to be the root class of services.
    This means that services are childs of this class, declared at "offers" attribute.

    As you derive from this class, if you provide __init__ in your own class,
    remember to call ALWAYS at base class __init__  as this:

        super(...., self).__init__(environment, values)

    The preferred method of provide initialization is to provide the :py:meth:`.initialize`,
    and do not overrie __init__ method. This (initialize) will be invoked after
    all internal initialization.

    This is a MUST, so internal structured gets filled correctly, so don't forget it!.

    Normally objects of classes deriving from this one, will be serialized, called,
    deserialized. This means that all that you want to ensure that is keeped inside
    the class must be serialized and deserialized, because there is no warantee that
    the object will get two methods invoked without haven't been removed from memory
    and loaded again. One thing to have into account on this are Form Fields, that
    default implementation marshals and unmashals them, so if your case is that you
    only need data that is keeped at form fields, marshal and unmarshal and in fact
    not needed.
