    This class is in fact an interface, and defines the logic of a publication
    for a Service.

    A publication is the preparation of the needs of a service before it can
    be provided to users. One good sample of this is, in case of virtual machines,
    to copy a machine to provide COWS of this copy to users.

    As always, do not forget to invoke base class __init__ if you override it as this::

       super().__init__(environment, **kwargs)

    This is a MUST, so internal structured gets filled correctly, so don't forget it!.

    The preferred method is not to override init, but provide the :py:meth:`.initialize`,
    that will be invoked just after all internal initialization is completed.

    Normally objects of classes deriving from this one, will be serialized, called,
    deserialized. This means that all that you want to ensure that is keeped inside
    the class must be serialized and deserialized, because there is no warantee that
    the object will get two methods invoked without haven't been remoded from memory
    and loaded again, this means, IMPLEMENT marshal and unmarshal with all attributes
    that you want to keep.

        action must be fast enough to do not block core), returning State.FINISHED.

        The second (asynchronous) are publications that could block the core, so
        it have to be done in more than one step.

              them whenever requested
