Report modules for UDS are contained inside this package.
To create a new rwpoer module, you will need to follow this steps:
    1.- Create the report module inside one of the existing (or new one) packages
    2.- Import the class of your report module at __init__. For example::
        from Report import SimpleReport
    3.- Done. At Server restart, the module will be recognized, loaded and treated

The registration of modules is done locating subclases of :py:class:`uds.core.reports.Report`
