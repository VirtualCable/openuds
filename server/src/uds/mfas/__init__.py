Authentication modules for uds are contained inside this module.
To create a new authentication module, you will need to follow this steps:
    1.- Create the authentication module, probably based on an existing one
    2.- Insert the module as child of this module
    3.- Import the class of your authentication module at __init__. For example::
        from Authenticator import SimpleAthenticator
    4.- Done. At Server restart, the module will be recognized, loaded and treated

The registration of modules is done locating subclases of :py:class:`uds.core.auths.Authentication`
