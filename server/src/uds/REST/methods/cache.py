        This login uses parameters to generate auth token
        The alternative is to use the template tag inside "REST" that is called auth_token, that extracts an auth token from an user session
        We can use any of this forms due to the fact that the auth token is in fact a session key
        Parameters:
            mandatory:
                username:
                password:
                auth:
            optional:
                locale: (defaults to "en")
        Result:
            on success: { 'result': 'ok', 'auth': [auth_code] }
            on error: { 'result: 'error', 'error': [error string] }
