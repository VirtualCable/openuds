                ERROR. The server is in error.
                HARD_REBOOT. The server is hard rebooting. This is equivalent to pulling the power plug on a physical server, plugging it back in, and rebooting it.
                MIGRATING. The server is being migrated to a new host.
                PASSWORD. The password is being reset on the server.
                PAUSED. In a paused state, the state of the server is stored in RAM. A paused server continues to run in frozen state.
                REBOOT. The server is in a soft reboot state. A reboot command was passed to the operating system.
                REBUILD. The server is currently being rebuilt from an image.
                RESCUED. The server is in rescue mode. A rescue image is running with the original server image attached.
                RESIZED. Server is performing the differential copy of data that changed during its initial copy. Server is down for this stage.
                REVERT_RESIZE. The resize or migration of a server failed for some reason. The destination server is being cleaned up and the original source server is restarting.
                SOFT_DELETED. The server is marked as deleted but the disk images are still available to restore.
                STOPPED. The server is powered off and the disk image still persists.
                SUSPENDED. The server is suspended, either by request or necessity. This status appears for only the XenServer/XCP, KVM, and ESXi hypervisors. Administrative users can suspend an instance if it is infrequently used or to perform system maintenance. When you suspend an instance, its VM state is stored on disk, all memory is written to disk, and the virtual machine is stopped. Suspending an instance is similar to placing a device in hibernation; memory and vCPUs become available to create other instances.
                VERIFY_RESIZE. System is awaiting confirmation that the server is operational after a move or resize.
                SHUTOFF. The server was powered down by the user, either through the OpenStack Compute API or from within the server. For example, the user issued a shutdown -h command from within the server. If the OpenStack Compute manager detects that the VM was powered down, it transitions the server to the SHUTOFF status.
