    At class instantiation, this will receive an environment with"generator",
    that are classes that provides a way to generate unique items.

    The generators provided right now are 'mac' and 'name'. To get more info
    about this, look at py:class:`uds.core.util.unique_mac_generator.UniqueNameGenerator`
    and py:class:`uds.core.util.unique_name_generator.UniqueNameGenerator`

    SampleUserDeploymentTwo. The main difference are the "...Cache".." methods,
    that here are not needed.

    As sample also of environment storage usage, wi will use here the provider
    storage to keep all our needed info, leaving marshal and unmarshal (needed
    by Serializble classes, like this) empty (that is, returns '' first and does
    nothing the second one)

    Also Remember, if you don't include this class as the user_service_type of the
    SampleServiceOne, or whenever you trie to access a service of SampleServiceOne,

        example), it will return "State.ERROR" and store a reason of error so UDS
        can ask for it and present this information to the Administrator.

        directly usable but can be put in an usable state, it will return
