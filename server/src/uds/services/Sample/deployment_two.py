    After creating at administration interface an Deployed Service, UDS will
    create consumable services for users using UserDeployment class as
    provider of this elements.

    At class instantiation, this will receive an environment with"generator",
    that are classes that provides a way to generate unique items.

    The generators provided right now are 'mac' and 'name'. To get more info
    about this, look at py:class:`uds.core.util.unique_mac_generator.UniqueNameGenerator`

    storage to keep all our needed info, leaving marshal and unmarshal (needed
