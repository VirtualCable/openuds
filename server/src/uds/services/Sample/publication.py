    This class shows how a publication is developed.

    In order to a publication to work correctly, we must provide at least the
    following methods:
        * Of course, the __init__
        * :py:meth:`.publish`
        * :py:meth:`.check_state`
        * :py:meth:`.finish`

    Also, of course, methods from :py:class:`uds.core.serializable.Serializable`


    Publication do not have an configuration interface, all data contained
    inside an instance of a Publication must be serialized if you want them between
    method calls.

    It's not waranteed that the class will not be serialized/deserialized
    between methods calls, so, first of all, implement the marshal and umnarshal
    mehods needed by all serializable classes.

    Also a thing to note is that operations requested to Publications must be
    *as fast as posible*. The operations executes in a separated thread,
    and so it cant take a bit more time to execute, but it's recommended that
    the operations executes as fast as posible, and, if it will take a long time,
    split operation so we can keep track of state.

    This means that, if we have "slow" operations, we must

    We first of all declares an estimation of how long a publication will take.
    This value is instance based, so if we override it in our class, the suggested
    time could change.

    The class attribute that indicates this suggested time is "suggested_delay", and
    it's expressed in seconds, (i.e. "suggested_delay = 10")

        This method is invoked whenever the administrator requests a new publication.

        The method is not invoked directly (i mean, that the administration request
        do no makes a call to this method), but a DelayedTask is saved witch will
        initiate all publication stuff (and, of course, call this method).

        You MUST implement it, so the publication do really something.
        All publications can be synchronous or asynchronous.

        The main difference between both is that first do whatever needed, (the
        action must be fast enough to do not block core), returning types.states.State.FINISHED.

        The second (asynchronous) are publications that could block the core, so
        it have to be done in more than one step.

        An example publication could be a copy of a virtual machine, where:
            * First we invoke the copy operation to virtualization provider
            * Second, we kept needed values inside instance so we can serialize
              them whenever requested
            * Returns an types.states.State.RUNNING, indicating the core that the publication
              has started but has to finish sometime later. (We do no check
              again the state and keep waiting here, because we will block the
              core untill this operation is finished).

        In our example wi will simple assign a name, and set number to 5. We
        will use this number later, to make a "delay" at check if the publication
        has finished. (see method check_state)

        We also will make this publication an "stepped one", that is, it will not
        finish at publish call but a later check_state call

        Take care with instantiating threads from here. Whenever a publish returns
        "types.states.State.RUNNING", the core will recheck it later, but not using this instance
        and maybe that even do not use this server.

        If you want to use threadings or somethin likt it, use DelayedTasks and
        do not block it. You also musht provide the mechanism to allow those
        DelayedTask to communicate with the publication.

        One sample could be, for example, to copy a bunch of files, but we know
        that this copy can take a long time and don't want it to take make it
        all here, but in a separate task. Now, do you remember that "environment"
        that is unique for every instance?, well, we can create a delayed task,
        and pass that environment (owned by this intance) as a mechanism for
        informing when the task is finished. (We insert at delayed tasks queue
        an instance, not a class itself, so we can instantiate a class and
        store it at delayed task queue.

        Also note that, in that case, this class can also acomplish that by simply
        using the suggested_delay attribute and the check_state method in most cases.
